# Connect-Four
Post Assessment for the Code2College Elite 101 Course

#### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to get an idea of the level of comfort each intern has with coding, so we can do our best to set you up for success with an internship opportunity during the Summer 2023 with our corporate partners. This is not graded, and you cannot fail this task, unless you do not attempt it at all or you plagiarize someone else’s code.

#### Due Date
You will have until 03/03/2023 (Friday, March 3rd) to complete and submit this assignment to Canvas.

## Rules
You cannot get help from anyone: classmates, instructors, family members, teachers
All code that you write must be your own work
You can use any online resources, as long as you do not plagiarize
Any websites, repls, githubs, articles, etc that you consult must be credited in your code in a comment


## Plagiarism
While we expect some students to know how to do this assignment without any outside resources, we do know that plenty of students may need help with some functions, syntax or some bigger concepts. However, there is a line between using a resource and plagiarizing the resource. 
The following would be examples of plagiarism:
Directly copying the code you found on someone else’s repl, github or website (even if you include the reference/citation)
Taking the code from someone else’s solution and changing some variable and function names so it looks a little different
Looking at someone else’s solution to get an idea of what they did, then closing it but writing pretty much the same thing afterwards

### How to use online resources without plagiarizing:
Look for only small, specific pieces of information, rather than large chunks of code
Reading an explanation or solution for something, then closing the source and trying to write your own version of how they approached the problem
Writing your own code, but after getting errors, checking some sources and making some changes to your own program based on some ideas you gathered

### How it is Evaluated
Your code will be evaluated based on several factors, including:
Completeness (how far did you make it into the challenge)
Syntax (is your code written properly)
Planning/Pseudocode (Do you have an overview or structure to your program or a Miro board plan)
Clarity/Documentation (Are variables and functions named well, do you have comments)
Logic/Reasoning (Does your solution, or plan, make sense. Will it work)

### What to Submit
You will submit two items to Canvas. These are:
1) The link to your replit with your solution and any plans/outlines you made
2) A short (must be less than 2 minutes) video of you explaining your solution while screen sharing your code. You do not need to show your face, only your code, while you explain. See this document for how to record your video. 

## The Challenge
Your goal in this challenge is to use Python to create a Connect 4 game. Connect 4 is a game where two players drop their tokens into different columns, with the goal of having 4 tokens in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. (See below for more information about Connect 4)

In your game, you won’t have a physical board, you will create one out of a list of lists and print it to the console for players to see. Players will be prompted for which column they want to put their token into, and then the board will update. Once someone has 4 in a row, the game will end. 

#### Some important requirements of a Connect 4 game:
When a player chooses a column, the token drops down to the lowest, unoccupied space
For our game, the board will be 6 x 6
Each time a player adds a token to the board, your game should check if they won, and also update the board and reprint it
Players tokens can be whatever you want… Xs and Os, 1s and 2s, Rs and Bs, etc. 
If you are unfamiliar with Connect 4, you can see a short video here

#### Some hints, suggestions and strategies
There are many processes that need to happen during this game. You should organize your code into different functions to do them. For example, a function to print the board, a function to check if anyone has won, a function to update the lists, etc. 
If you are struggling to get a certain function to work, try to make a simpler version of it to start. Example, you don’t know how to check if someone won diagonally, then just start with horizontally and build from there, or if you don’t know how to make the player’s token go all the way to the lowest unoccupied space, then start with something similar to Tic Tac Toe and build from there.
To create the board, you will need a list of lists (nested lists), and to print it, you can use a simple for loop. Check out this repl for an example of a board. 


#### Final Notes
Again, it is okay if at the end of this, you don’t have a fully working game of Connect 4. What you need to make sure you have is something that shows your thought process, your coding logic and how you organize a coding task. 
Leaving your project blank, or saying “I don’t know” isn’t an acceptable answer. You have time to do some research and make a plan, even if you don’t fully know how to code all of it. 
When you start planning, remember to think about UCASE, and some of the resources we utilized in class, like Miro boards or any other way that you find it helpful to plan!
